#  Gridworld is a maze env, you can change the grid_world.py to make your own maze.
The solution is A3C. The result is better than DQN and the time for traing is not very big.  
You can train the game in your computer with a cpu, because the model without conv layer.

# Dependency

Python = 3.6  
Pytorch = 1.0 +  
Gym = 0.7  

# File Structure

You can run the train_agent_gridworld.py to make the train start, and enjoy the model by the file: enjoy.py  

# Par

If the par isn't very well, so you can change it by yourself.   
The par I used is the same as the par in openai baseline
