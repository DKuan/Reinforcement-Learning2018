#  Gridworld is a maze env, you can change the grid_world.py to make your own maze.
The solution is DQN, but I think the solution isn't very well, so there will be a A3C solution.

# Dependency

Python = 3.6  
Pytorch = 1.0 +  
Gym = 0.7  

# File Structure

You can run the train_agent_gridworld.py to make the train start, and enjoy the model by the file: enjoy_dqn.py  

# Par

The par isn't very well, so you can change it by yourself.
